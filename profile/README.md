## Hello, it's Kirous 👋

Kirous is a Finnish game studio. We are on a mission to develop meaningful games that foster creativity in our players. It's time to get creative!

### 🪐 What we're doing

We make games. We're currently building a game called Rustforge. It's a strategic automation game where you defend your virtualized human colony from a hostile force. The game is targeted for PC players and is currently being prepared towards a Steam release.

### 🛠️ How we're doing it

We're building our games with the Unity game engine. To support our games, we have backend services that are built mostly with Node.js and Express inside Docker containers. We've chosen to use Github Actions and Jenkins to make shipping our games as easy as possible.

### 📯 How to get involved

We have an open [Discord community](https://discord.gg/DyYE8Qq) that's focused on our game development projects. If you're interested in our games, feel free to join and get involved. See you there! 👋
